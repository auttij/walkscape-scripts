This guide is obviously work in progress, but I will update it with some of my findings in the next few days, before information is added to the wiki.

I highly recommend exploring the game and new content on your own, without the use of this guide, but I will write these things down regardless.
Use this guide at your own discretion

### How to access Syrenthia
By default, areas related to Syrenthia are not visible on the map.
To get them to show up, you need to find and have equipped three pieces of diving gear.

The starting set for diving gear is hidden throughout Jarvonia. The three pieces and their locations are:
- Rusty Diving Helmet
  - From Frosthook Emporium shop in Port Skildar
  - Cost 500 gold
- Rusty Diving Torso
  - From Adventurers' Guild Outpost in Horn of Respite
  - Cost 20 Adventurers' guild tokens
- Rusty Diving Leggings
  - Common drop from Sunken Chests. You should get one from 1 or 2 chests
  - Sunken chests have the same 1/250 drop chance as other chests, and drop from specific activities
    - Seashell Searching (Beach of Woes)
    - Swimming Activities (Red Coast, Farsand Coast, Granfiddich Shores)

With your Rusty diving gear equipped, you can see Syrenthia, and access it from two locations: Port Skildar, or Granfiddich Shores.

## Syrenthia
### Diving Gear
There are 3 tiers of diving gear
1. Rusty
2. Kelp (Advanced)
3. Hydrilium (Expert)
  - Requires Complete the Swimming (Expert) activity 25 times

There are more items that function as expert diving gear

To do anything underwater you need to wear three pieces of diving gear. Certain locations might require a certain tier of diving gear, or higher.
